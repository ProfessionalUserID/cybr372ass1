Completed Sections for this assignment:
Part 1
Part 2

For this assignment, I have created a file encryptor that encrypts and decrypts files through both the intelliJ terminal and the command line.
For my design, I took inspiration from the provided code and the O'Reilly videos that were supplied alongside this assignment.
I have tested my design and have found that part 1 works correctly, however I was having issues with part 2 getting it to run
on the command line.

My part 1 code has in depth comments, my part 2 code has comments documenting the changes between the two different .java files.

INSTRUCTIONS:

In order to use the programs, I have provided instructions in the form of print statements within the code.
Simply run the java file you wish to use and follow the instructions printed out in the terminal. I have also
provided a plaintext.txt file that can be used for testing.
